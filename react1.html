  <h2> 1. What is Virtual DOM</h2>
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
    <li> React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM in the memory, and that is known as the virtual DOM.</li>
    <li> When the state of an object changes, the virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating all the objects.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2>2. What is SPA ?</h2>
<p>A single-page application(SPA) is an application that loads a single HTML page and all the necessary assets 
    (such as JavaScript and CSS) required for the application to run.Any interactions with the page or subsequent 
    pages do not require a round trip to the server which means the page is not reloaded.</p>

<h2>3. What is difference between class and functional component</h2>
<table border="2" width="70%" align="center">
    <thead>
        <tr> 
            <th>Functional</th>
            <th>Class</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>A functional component is just a plain JavaScript pure function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element(JSX).</td>
            <td>A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element. </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>There is no render method used in functional components.</td>
            <td>It must have the render() method returning JSX.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Also known as Stateless components as they simply accept data and display them in some form, that responsible for rendering UI.</td>
            <td>Also known as Stateful components because they implement logic and state.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>There is no React lifecycle methods instead they have Hooks in functional components to make them Stateful. </td>
            <td>React lifecycle methods can be used inside class components.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Constructors are not used.</td>
            <td>Constructor are used as it needs to store state. </td>
        </tr>       
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>4. What does mean by state and its use in react?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component ,i.e., it is not accessible to any other component till the owner component decides to pass it.</li>
    <li>it is used to manipulate data within a component.</li>
    <li>it can be declared within a Constructor or outside constructor.</li>
    <li>it can be changed using this.setState only.</li>
    <li>it changes can be asynchronous.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2>5. What is JSX and why do we use it instead of js?</h2>
<p>JSX is popularly used in React, as it makes the job of building an application much easier. JSX is an addition to the JavaScript syntax which is a mixture of both HTML and JavaScript. Both JS and JSX are interchangeable but JSX makes the code easier to understand for users.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>6. What is package.json ?</h2>
<p>It is a JSON file that lives in the root directory of your project. Your package.json holds important information about the project. It contains human-readable metadata about the project</p>
